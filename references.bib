  abstract = {The sustainability of food systems is commonly measured at the global or national level using multidimensional indices. However, it is not possible to use such indices at subnational levels, because the data for many indicators are not available and large countries such as Brazil have completely different food systems depending on the state or region considered. This paper presents a sustainable food systems framework for Brazil and the Brazilian Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS), which is the first index of its kind that considers local behaviors and actions to rank states and regions of the country. The dimensions and indicators included in the index were identified from a literature review and an exclusion criteria, which considered the Brazilian context, that ended up with 17 indicators divided in three dimensions (environmental, socioeconomic, and nutritional). We followed well-known procedures to create an interpretable multidimensional index, which include normalization, weighting, aggregating, and sensitivity analysis. The performance of the states was starkly different, regarding the indicators and dimensions considered. No state presented a high score for all three dimensions, and even states with a high MISFS score had room to improve in one or two dimensions. In general, high-income states scored well on socioeconomic indicators (e.g., agriculture education), but poorly on most environmental indicators (e.g., water footprint), and some nutritional indicators (e.g., obesity rate). This index is the first initiative to measure the Brazilian food systems according to local practices and behaviors at state level and it is a starting point to help policymakers understand the opportunities of improvement of their food systems. This study may also help other countries to develop their own frameworks and strategies to improve their regionalized food systems.},

These changes in the delineation of spatial units pose a difficulty for any research that intends to use regional data from different years. The present paper develops a routine for the generation of time-consistent 'Minimum Comparable Areas' (AMC) for any arbitrary sub-period between two census years in the range between the first and last demographic census 1872-2010. It relies on recently compiled material by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The corresponding Stata code is provided in the Appendix of the paper.

Climate variability is increasing in the region, affecting food security across availability, access, utilization, and stability.

  abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

It is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations. Here we describe the construction of a major new version, CRU TS v4. It is updated to span 1901–2018 by the inclusion of additional station observations, and it will be updated annually. The interpolation process has been changed to use angular-distance weighting (ADW), and the production of secondary variables has been revised to better suit this approach. This implementation of ADW provides improved traceability between each gridded value and the input observations, and allows more informative diagnostics that dataset users can utilise to assess how dataset quality might vary geographically.},

In general, our results show that Ankara experienced six severe and two extreme drought events during the reference period, 1971–2000. However, the projections indicate fewer drought events for the near-future period of 2016–2040, with no potential extreme drought events. While the RCP4.5 scenario showed that dry spells will be dominant in the second half of the near-future period, the RCP8.5 scenario projected that dry spells will be evenly distributed during the entire near-future period.},

The aim was two-fold: to present the MISFS updating process (MISFS-R), and to show the applicability of MISFS-R to uncover local geopolitical priorities. Methods: Based on a systematized review and sensitivity analysis, 46 indicators were selected to compose the MISFS-R social, nutritional, environmental, and economic dimensions. Official Brazilian datasets allowed the MISFS-R scoring for 26 Brazilian states and capitals. Correlations between MISFS-R dimensions were analyzed by Spearman's coefficient. A cluster analysis was used to check for Brazilian states similarities and priorities. Findings: Economic and environmental performance were inversely related, while economic performance was directly related to social and nutritional scores. Four clusters were formed with marked differences in their food systems sustainability profile.},

This paper presents a tutorial for the teaching of data testing procedures, often referred to as hypothesis testing theories. The first procedure introduced is Fisher's approach to data testing—tests of significance; the second is Neyman-Pearson's approach—tests of acceptance; the final procedure is the incongruent combination of the previous two theories into the current approach—NSHT. For those researchers sticking with the latter, two compromise solutions on how to improve NHST conclude the tutorial.},

O Sisvan tem por objetivo consolidar os dados referentes às ações de Vigilância Alimentar e Nutricional (VAN) da Atenção Primária à Saúde (APS). A versão totalmente eletrônica do Sisvan apresenta dados de antropometria e de marcadores do consumo alimentar desde 2008. Deste modo, agrega os registros de estado nutricional provenientes do Sistema de Gestão do Programa Auxílio Brasil (atual programa de transferência condicionada de renda denominado até meados de 2021, como Programa Bolsa Família), bem como os registros de estado nutricional e de marcadores do consumo alimentar inseridos pelo e-SUS APS. E considerando que os dados do Sisvan são individualizados e organizados segundo CNS (Cartão Nacional de Saúde), os relatórios obtidos a partir do Sisvan permitem a avaliação de frequências relativas, logo, fornecem prevalências de estado nutricional e de marcadores do consumo alimentar da população atendida na APS. Conteúdo As bases de dados disponibilizadas nesta Plataforma referem-se aos dados individualizados e anonimizados de todas as pessoas atendidas quanto ao estado nutricional (antropometria) em serviços de APS do Brasil desde 2008. Neste sentido, poderão ser identificados um ou mais registros de antropometria para uma mesma pessoa. Esta medida permite a cessão de dados contidos nas bases nacionais dos sistemas de informação em saúde (que é o caso do Sisvan) e, portanto, cabe o atendimento à Lei de Acesso à Informação e Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados, por isso os dados serão disponibilizados com sigilo da informação pessoal, não sendo permitido o rastreio ou identificação de qualquer cidadão, mas poderá ser avaliada a prevalência de indicadores nutricionais. Limitações Conforme indicado no conteúdo, as bases são disponibilizadas com várias origens de dados, dessa forma, pode haver mais de um acompanhamento por indivíduo. Orientamos sempre em priorizar acompanhamentos gerados pelo SISVAN, AUXÍLIO BRASIL/BOLSA FAMÍLIA e por último E-SUS, nos casos de acompanhamentos com a mesma data. Os relatórios públicos do SISVAN consolidam sempre o último acompanhamento do indivíduo, dessa forma, realizar uma comparação entre a base disponibilizada e o consolidado do sistema, pode ocasionar uma diferença razoável, visto que existem dados sendo incorporados semanalmente.},

The SPEI is based on precipitation and temperature data, and it has the advantage of combining multiscalar character with the capacity to include the effects of temperature variability on drought assessment. The procedure to calculate the index is detailed and involves a climatic water balance, the accumulation of deficit/surplus at different time scales, and adjustment to a log-logistic probability distribution. Mathematically, the SPEI is similar to the standardized precipitation index (SPI), but it includes the role of temperature. Because the SPEI is based on a water balance, it can be compared to the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI). Time series of the three indices were compared for a set of observatories with different climate characteristics, located in different parts of the world. Under global warming conditions, only the sc-PDSI and SPEI identified an increase in drought severity associated with higher water demand as a result of evapotranspiration. Relative to the sc-PDSI, the SPEI has the advantage of being multiscalar, which is crucial for drought analysis and monitoring.},

  abstract = {There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
